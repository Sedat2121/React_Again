# HTML5 Interview Questions

1. What is an iframe and how it works?
An iframe is an HTML document which can be embedded inside onther HTML page.

```
<iframe src="https://github.com" height="300px" width="300px"></iframe>
```

The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

Tip: Use CSS to style the <iframe>

Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the <iframe> is.

2.Explain meta tags in HTML

3.What is the purpose of the alt attribute on images?
The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The alt attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purposes, in which case it should be left empty.

4.What is difference between span and div?
-div is a block element
-span is inline element
For bonus points, you could point out that it’s illegal to place a block element inside an inline element, and that while div can have a p tag, and a p tag can have a span, it is not possible for span to have a div or p tag inside.

5.How can i get indexed better by search engines?
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:

```
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword keyword">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="description of your site">
```

Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.

6.HTML5 specifications?
HTML5 was designed to replace HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2. The key goals and motivations behind the HTML5 specification were to:

Deliver rich content (graphics, movies, etc.) without the need for additional plugins, such as Flash.
Provide better semantic support for web page structure through new structural element tags.
Provide a stricter parsing standard to simplify error handling, ensure more consistent cross-browser behaviour, and simplify compatibility with documents written to older standards.
Provide better cross-platform support whether running on a PC, Tablet, or Smartphone.

7.How can you highlight text in HTML?
If you are working with an HTML5 page, the <mark> tag can be a quick and easy way of highlighting or marking text on a page:

```
<mark>highlighted text</mark>
```

To highlight text with just HTML code and support for all browsers, set the background-color style, as shown in the example below, using the HTML tag.

```
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Yellow text.</span>
```

8.HTML5 Semantic Tags:
-<header> is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

-<article> is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it’s meaining. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

-<section> is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

<footer> is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

9.What is Character Encoding(character set)?
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set (character encoding) to use. This is specified in the tag:

```
HTML4:

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
```

```
HTML5:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

10.What is a self closing tag?

```
In HTML5 it is not strictly necessary to close certain HTML tags. The tags that aren’t required to have specific closing tags are called “self closing” tags.

An example of a self closing tag is something like a line break (<br />) or the meta tag (<meta>). This means that the following are both acceptable:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
...
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

```

12.HTML attribute and property?

```
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML: <input type="text" value="Hello">.

const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!

```

# 13. An understanding of general web issues such as web browser rendering differences, W3C accessibility guidelines

```
Web Browser Rendering Differences: Web browsers may interpret and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code differently, leading to inconsistencies in how web pages are displayed. It's essential to test your website across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and versions to identify and address any rendering issues.

Responsive Web Design: With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's important to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes. Responsive web design techniques, such as using flexible layouts, media queries, and fluid images, enable your site to be easily accessible and visually appealing across various devices.

W3C Accessibility Guidelines: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provides accessibility guidelines to ensure that websites are usable by people with disabilities. These guidelines cover areas like providing alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, proper use of headings, color contrast, and more. Adhering to these guidelines improves accessibility and inclusivity.

Performance Optimization: Website performance significantly impacts user experience. Optimizing page load times by minimizing file sizes, leveraging caching techniques, optimizing images, and reducing server requests can enhance the overall speed and responsiveness of your website.

Security Considerations: Web security is crucial to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Implementing secure coding practices, validating and sanitizing user inputs, using HTTPS for secure communication, and staying updated with security patches and frameworks help mitigate security risks.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Optimizing your website for search engines improves its visibility and organic traffic. This involves techniques like using descriptive page titles, relevant meta tags, proper header structure, clean URLs, well-structured content, and mobile-friendliness.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: As mentioned earlier, web browsers may interpret code differently. Ensuring cross-browser compatibility involves testing and making necessary adjustments to ensure your website functions correctly and appears consistent across various browsers and their different versions.

Usability and User Experience (UX): Designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces enhances the overall user experience. Pay attention to factors like clear navigation, logical information architecture, intuitive forms, readable typography, and overall visual appeal.

Web Standards and Validation: Adhering to web standards helps ensure compatibility, maintainability, and future-proofing of your website. Tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service can help identify HTML and CSS code errors, ensuring compliance with best practices.

Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation: Embrace the concept of progressive enhancement by starting with a solid foundation of accessible HTML content and then adding enhanced features using CSS and JavaScript. Graceful degradation ensures that your website still functions and remains accessible to users even if certain features or technologies are not supported.

By considering these web issues, you can create websites that are visually consistent, accessible, performant, secure, and user-friendly across various platforms and browsers.

# 14 SQL database
```
In SQL, you can perform various operations on a database, such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, deleting data, and retrieving data based on specific conditions. Here are some common SQL statements:

CREATE TABLE: This statement is used to create a new table in the database, specifying the table's columns, data types, and any constraints.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE TableName (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    ...
);
INSERT INTO: This statement is used to insert data into a table.
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO TableName (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
SELECT: This statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM TableName
WHERE condition;
UPDATE: This statement is used to modify existing data in a table.
sql
Copy code
UPDATE TableName
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
DELETE: This statement is used to remove data from a table.
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM TableName
WHERE condition;
These are just a few examples of SQL statements. SQL provides many other capabilities, such as joining multiple tables, grouping data, sorting results, and more.

It's important to note that different database management systems (DBMS) may have variations in SQL syntax and features, although the core SQL functionality remains the same. Popular DBMS that use SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite, among others.

Agile development methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to Agile, here are some commonly recognized best practices:

Cross-functional teams: Agile teams should consist of individuals with diverse skills necessary to complete the project, including developers, testers, designers, and business analysts. This encourages collaboration and shared responsibility.

Iterative and incremental development: Agile projects are divided into short iterations or sprints, where small increments of the product are developed, tested, and delivered. This iterative approach allows for frequent feedback and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.

Regular communication and collaboration: Agile teams promote open and transparent communication among team members and stakeholders. Daily stand-up meetings, regular demonstrations of work-in-progress, and frequent interactions help in fostering collaboration and keeping everyone aligned.

Prioritization and backlog management: Maintaining a prioritized backlog of user stories or tasks is crucial in Agile. The product owner, in collaboration with the team, ensures that the most valuable and important items are worked on first.

Continuous integration and automated testing: Agile teams strive for continuous integration of code changes to a shared repository, accompanied by automated tests. This ensures that the software is always in a deployable state and helps identify issues early.

Frequent feedback and retrospectives: Agile methodologies encourage feedback loops to gather insights from stakeholders and end-users. Regular retrospectives provide an opportunity to reflect on the project, identify areas of improvement, and make adjustments to enhance team performance.

Adaptability and flexibility: Agile teams embrace change and are responsive to evolving requirements. They prioritize customer satisfaction and are willing to adjust plans, timelines, and features as needed.

Continuous improvement and learning: Agile promotes a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Teams regularly reflect on their processes, seek feedback, and explore ways to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Self-organizing teams: Agile teams are empowered to make decisions collectively and are self-organizing. This promotes ownership, accountability, and a sense of responsibility among team members.

Visual project management: Agile teams often use visual boards or project management tools like Kanban or Scrum boards to provide visibility into the project's progress, tasks, and priorities. This helps in tracking work, identifying bottlenecks, and improving workflow.

Remember, Agile is a mindset, and it's important to tailor the practices to suit the specific needs and context of your project and team.
