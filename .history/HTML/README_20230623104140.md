# HTML5 Interview Questions

1. What is an iframe and how it works?
An iframe is an HTML document which can be embedded inside onther HTML page.
```
<iframe src="https://github.com" height="300px" width="300px"></iframe>
```
The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

Tip: Use CSS to style the <iframe>

Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the <iframe> is.

2. Explain meta tags in HTML


3. What is the purpose of the alt attribute on images? 
The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The alt attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purposes, in which case it should be left empty.

4. What is difference between span and div? 
-div is a block element
-span is inline element
For bonus points, you could point out that it’s illegal to place a block element inside an inline element, and that while div can have a p tag, and a p tag can have a span, it is not possible for span to have a div or p tag inside.

5. How can i get indexed better by search engines?
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:
```
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword keyword">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="description of your site">
```
Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.

6. HTML5 specifications?
HTML5 was designed to replace HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2. The key goals and motivations behind the HTML5 specification were to:

Deliver rich content (graphics, movies, etc.) without the need for additional plugins, such as Flash.
Provide better semantic support for web page structure through new structural element tags.
Provide a stricter parsing standard to simplify error handling, ensure more consistent cross-browser behaviour, and simplify compatibility with documents written to older standards.
Provide better cross-platform support whether running on a PC, Tablet, or Smartphone.

7. How can you highlight text in HTML?
If you are working with an HTML5 page, the <mark> tag can be a quick and easy way of highlighting or marking text on a page:
```
<mark>highlighted text</mark>
```
To highlight text with just HTML code and support for all browsers, set the background-color style, as shown in the example below, using the HTML tag.
```
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Yellow text.</span>
```
8. HTML5 Semantic Tags:
-<header> is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

-<article> is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it’s meaining. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

-<section> is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

<footer> is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

9. What is Character Encoding(character set)?
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set (character encoding) to use. This is specified in the tag:
```
HTML4:

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
```
```
HTML5:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
10. What is a self closing tag? 
```
In HTML5 it is not strictly necessary to close certain HTML tags. The tags that aren’t required to have specific closing tags are called “self closing” tags.

An example of a self closing tag is something like a line break (<br />) or the meta tag (<meta>). This means that the following are both acceptable:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
...
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

```

12. HTML attribute and property?
```
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML: <input type="text" value="Hello">.

const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!

```
