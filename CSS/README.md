# CSS Interview Questions

1. Three main ways to apply CSS?
```
Using the inline style attribute on an element

<div>
    <p style="color: maroon;"></p>
</div>
Using a <style> block in the <head> section of your HTML

<head>
    <title>CSS Refresher</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: sans-serif;
            font-size: 1.2em;
        }
    </style>
</head>
Loading an external CSS file using the <link> tag

<head>
    <title>CSS Refresher</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
</head>
```
2. What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

CSS was intended to allow web professionals to separate the content and structure of a website's code from the visual design.

3. SASS 
Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable.
```
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

4. Explain CSS sprites, and how would you implement them on a page or site?

CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is commonly used technique for icons (Gmail uses it).

Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.
Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with background-image, background-position and background-size properties defined.
To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.
Advantages:

Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.
Advance downloading of assets that wonâ€™t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.
