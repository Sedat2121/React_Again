# Linkedin Interview questions

1. Tell me about yourself?
```
Tips;
This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.
 
Be succinct, honest and engaging.
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.
 
Use the job description to prepare.
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.
 
Tie your story to their needs.
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.
```

I was always a problem solver. 

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most.

I’ve taken on many different types of projects. 

I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles.

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.

2. What is your greatest strength? 
```
When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.
 
Describe a relevant experience.
If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.
 
Give specific details.
Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.
 
Show them you’re a well-rounded person.
For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.
```
My greatest strength is strategic thinking.

Over the last several years, I’ve realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized.

My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the business. This well-rounded view allows me to connect with colleagues from disparate departments and points of view quickly and authentically.

3. What is your greatest weakness? 
```
This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:
 
Be humble.
You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.
 
Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.
For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role
 
Show how you manage it.
Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.
```
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines.

In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives

I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible.

4. Why sould we hire you?
```
This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:
 
Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified.
Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.
 
Tell them how you’d fit in.
Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well.
 
Speak authentically.
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.
```
I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

I’m motivated and excited to learn your company’s unique business model, and from my interactions with the employees here, I can see that we share values like respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experiences and attitude for the job and think that my varied experience can add a lot of value here.

I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year. Given the growth moment that your company is poised to have, I believe that my unique experience will be an asset to your team. I’m excited to expand my expertise within a new industry, and recommend key strategies and opportunities that will support and drive business. Why this answer worked well:The answer featured a blend of quantifiable results and personal strengths.There was clear awareness of the company’s trajectory and enthusiasm for the role.

5. Why do you want to work here?
```
Make it all about them.
Your best answer will be about what they need. It'll show that you've done your research and have thought through what you can contribute to that team.
 
Show them how you can help.
Weave your story into the context of what you can contribute. If you have strong accounting skills and are interviewing for a finance role at a humane society, you could suggest that this job would allow you to blend your professional skills with your passion for animals.
 
Speak from the heart.
Telling a genuine story can make a big difference. For example, I once worked with a client who was applying for a zoo event manager job and she had grown up next door to that zoo and had great memories of the peacocks flying over the fence and sitting on her dad's car. So her answer was that she wanted people to have fun memories of that zoo just like she did. Try to top that.
```

I have spoken to people who worked here previously and I was always highly impressed on how highly they spoke about the company and how well they developed themselves. I admire your mentor program and have always believed that mentorship is key to a company’s success and an individual’s personal and professional growth. I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting fast growth company with such a potential with my skills well-suited to add value to the company’s growth. Within the last three years, for example, I set the goal of growing and evolving my team. I was able to coach and promote three different partnership employees into new roles. I was also able to optimize pricing and promotions, which saved the company money and resources and exceeded revenue projections three years in a row. My track record of outperforming expectations and ability lead will help accelerate the fascinating growth you are seeing

I understand that you’re looking for a leader who can implement and scale your data analytics platform. Over the course of my career, I have implemented data analytics platforms for 3 companies. Each had its own unique challenges and required me to learn, grow, and expand my skill set. I’m energized by new and complex challenges, and have the background, experience, and successful track record required to implement this system within your organization. The space in which your company operates is also of personal interest to me and I would love to contribute to it and help the company grow. When I started at my current company, I had a team of 4 people which I scaled to 28 people. I led the team in designing and building a big data platform for this big global company. Ultimately, we expanded the user base from 100 to 1,200. I’m looking forward to the next chapter and challenge, and believe I can bring real value to this organization

6. Tell me about a time you showed leadership
```
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.
 
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.
```

Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project

I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn’t their reporting manager but I was the project lead, so I asked them to explain the pros and cons of their approach. I encouraged them to fairly assess their solutions and moderated the discussion so that it stayed productive and respectful.

During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall.

I joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch which was moderately successful, but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains. I quickly realized that we’d need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future. I helped rationalize the short-term experiment roadmap, organized execution, removed roadblocks, and helped ship few of the high potential experiments. Concurrently, I spent time with the executive team to understand their expectations. After observing users and analyzing our logs, I partnered with team leads across Engineering, Design, and Research to develop an updated mission statement and a set of defined success metrics. Within 3 months, we were charging full-speed ahead with an updated roadmap, improvement operational metrics, and significant boost on a platform satisfaction survey. Two years later, the product had been used by hundreds of millions of people every month — 40 times the amount we started with

8. What would your co-workers say about you?
```
Find features that fit.
Re-read the job description and look for answers that go well with it. For example, if they need a strong problem solver, maybe you can share that your office nickname is “The Fixer” because you're so good at solving tough challenges.
 
Share some of your reviews.
Before the interview, go through your LinkedIn recommendations and performance reviews and see if there are some gold nuggets you might want to show them. And if it's on LinkedIn, mention it to the interviewers so they can read the whole recommendation if they want more detail.
 
Back it up with evidence.
If you think your colleagues would say that you're super creative, resist the urge to say “People like that I can think outside of the box”. Instead, share a tangible example of your creativity that ties to the job description.
```
I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time. I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday. I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too

I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what’s most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we’re all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my “infectious enthusiasm” with others and rally the team, and also means that I spend a lot of time with my work to make sure it’s done well. My teams have solid track records of hitting if not exceeding their goals because of this focus and ability to motivate. A good example was when I was working with quite a large group, and our project was given to us top-down. This didn’t feel empowering for the team, but I worked with leadership and our user research team to help the engineers and designers recognize the value of what we were working on. It was slated to be a multiyear project, but because the team was motivated and we focused on creating specifications for the product, we were able to deliver a prototype in just a few months. 

9. Why do you want to leave your current role?
```
Hiring managers will often ask this question, and it's a test. Are you running away from something, or are you running towards something? The advice when you get this question is simple:
 
Stay positive.
Employers want to see that you have a good attitude in general. Resist the temptation to say bad things about your current job, employer, or boss.
 
Focus on where you’d like to go.
You should come off as someone who is looking forward, not backward. Portray your interests more in the light of what you want to get out of your next role.
 
Bring it back to them.
Show them that you’ve done your homework about their company, and relate what you tell them back to the specific job you're interviewing for.
```
I'm eager to find a new opportunity and grow. As you can see, I've been doing the same kind of work for two and a half years, and I'm starting to stagnate. My company doesn't have a role open for the next step up, unfortunately. So, I'm excited about the opportunity of becoming a sales manager at your company. The new role will let me use the skills I've developed in my current role like making cold calls; hooking in new clients with pithy-but-inspiring opening lines; following up with carefully crafted emails; listening to their pain points; and then offering up solutions that can solve their problems. I'm eager to make a fresh start, and I want to use my cold calling and listening skills to help craft an even better solution with the product I'd be working on in this new role

I believe that the key to long-term professional growth is gathering critical, foundational experiences. In my case, my aspiration is to lead a large multinational business in a general managerial capacity. To get there, I have identified a set of enabling experiences, and have been very intentional in choosing my roles and assignments so far. While I have learned an immense amount in my current role as a strategic insights marketing manager, I believe that it’s the right time to expand my learning with a new challenge. Over the last 4 years, I have worked across a variety of marketing, strategy, and sales assignments across different global regions. I’ve built a strong understanding of how to sustainably grow brands & businesses through consumer-centric strategies. 

10. Describe your most challenged project
```
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.

In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals. I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable. In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus

I was brought into a project right before the ramp, when the existing team ran into a blocker issue. They were severely constrained in both resources and time, and didn’t have the bandwidth to address it. Obviously, there was a lot at stake. The expectation was that I would quickly solve the issue, but I was coming in completely cold and the team was stressed and resistant to stop what they were doing to bring me up to speed. Success required two things. First, I needed to clearly explain exactly what I needed from each team member — and why. Second, I needed to gather this information and context as quickly and efficiently as possible.

11. Tell me about something you have accoplished that you are proud of
```
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.

```
In my role on the innovation strategy team, I helped create a long-term innovation pipeline which led to multiple product launches for a critical business unit. While the company was a market leader in the space, we had been rapidly losing market share over the last few years. My first action was to identify the root cause of our declines. Through a detailed analysis, I identified that our product lineup didn’t fully satisfy evolving consumer needs. I also examined our past product launches and found that they’d lacked differentiated utility. I got approval from leadership to take an end-to-end approach using design thinking. We started with consumer immersions to understand how our products are used and which barriers we’d need to overcome. From there, we created new product concepts. We tested the concepts with consumers and created a long-term innovation pipeline. Finally, we partnered with cross-functional teams to charter and launch 3 products in just 2 years. This increased market share for the first time in 5 years, and we have seen sustained sales growth ever since. 


12. Can you explain your employment gap?
```
Most people are nervous about how a gap will be perceived—even if there's a good explanation, But if they’ve invited you in for an interview, then the gap hasn’t ruled you out. Here are some tips on how to discuss it:
 
Be honest.
The truth will set you free. Try to put the situation into the best light and don't lie; it's bound to come back and haunt you. So if your job was eliminated through a merger, just say so.
 
Speak with confidence.
For example, if you had taken some time away from working, avoid acting like you're embarrassed, apologetic or ashamed. The interviewer is going to pick up on that. Instead, pause and you see how they respond. The more calm, succinct and confident you are, the more at ease the interviewer will be with your answer—and with you.
 
Show the benefits of your time off.
Bring up the good that came out of that time whether you were laid off, stepped away to be with family, or even got fired. It's a great way to reframe the situation and an opportunity to showcase some useful skills that you gained during that time.
```
Looking at my resume, you’ll notice I have an employment gap of 5 months. I was relocating internationally and had to go through the administrative process of procuring my travel visa and work authorization permits. During this time, I couldn’t legally be employed abroad. The time off was a blessing. It allowed me to recharge my batteries and use the time to stay current with industry and consumer trends. I took the opportunity to evaluate my career journey and make sure I was working towards my long-term goal of being a multinational general manager. Without the day-to-day hustle, I was able to be introspective and distill the lessons I’d taken away in previous roles, and start planning my intentions for the next. I also used the time to read up on the latest developments in design thinking and innovation, and even took a couple online courses in these spaces

13. What are your salary expectations?
```
This is a question you'll get all too often, so here are a few tips to help you master the answer:
 
Give them a salary range.
Let them know there’s room to negotiate (instead of starting with a specific number). Avoid going too low though, because that's going to work against your interests. And don’t go too high either, or you may freeze yourself out of the opportunity.
 
Do some neutral research.
Give them a reasonable place to start from. You can use a resource like the LinkedIn Salary Tool to find out what other companies are paying people in this role and share with them what you learned about this salary range. Then they’ll have to base their compensation at least on those numbers because you've let them know what other similar organizations are giving to employees who do that job.
 
Bring up signing bonuses. 
Doing this can create a win-win situation for both parties. At the end of a negotiation, asking for extra money up top is often a way to bridge the gap between what you want and what you’re being offered.
```
I've been doing some research on the market for the role of Sales Analyst. What I found from LinkedIn's salary tool is that here in Chicago, base pay for these jobs tends to run between $61,000 and $71,000. Half the companies pay bonuses as well. Given the global impact of your company, and the fact that candidates with Master's degrees, like me, are being recruited most heavily, I think we should be looking toward the top end of that range. Why this answer worked well:She started off by giving a salary range instead of a specific number.She brought neutral research to the table, which establishes her as someone who's trustworthy, bold and grounded.She did a credible job of showing why she should be at that higher range, which made her come across as confident and steady.

14. What you do like to do outside of work?
```
With this question, employers are looking to get a feel for your likability and cultural fit. So what should you say—and not say? Here are a few tips.
 
Pick one of your favorites.
Go ahead and share something about your hobbies, volunteer work, or the places you enjoy traveling to. Maybe you're taking classes to help you accelerate your skills. In general, you just want to tell them something that's true and will paint you as an interesting, healthy, or good human being.
 
Keep it short.
For example, if you're a bird watcher in your free time, skip the 22-minute account of every species you've ever documented. Share enthusiastically so your passion shines through, but don't ramble on endlessly. Doing so might give the people to whom you're trying to make a good impression the feeling that you're nervous or that brevity just isn't your strong suit.
 
Stick to appropriate topics.
Avoid anything that might be pulverizing or offends somebody who's not a part of a particular group like politics or religion. Choose something uncontroversial or beneficial, and take advantage of the opportunity to show them that you're the complete package.
```
I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I’ve backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across Asia, South and Central America. For our honeymoon, my wife and I travelled northern India for 6 weeks. It’s a very diverse region, home to Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists, and we really enjoyed spending time in a few different states. We did a diverse set of activities like hiking the Himalayas and Ladakh, finding cool hot springs, and Vipassana meditation. Vipassan is a 10 days of silence meditation. I’ve really connected with the technique and have found it to be a powerful way to focus my attention and reset myself. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed interest in learning from people with different backgrounds.The answer included hobbies centered around health and self-improvement.

Outside of work, I enjoy fitness training, perfecting my golf swing, writing and recording music, and taking care of my dogs. This year I will be releasing my 4th album, which is all-instrumental, featuring classical guitar. I play every instrument and record tracks at my home office. Currently, two are streaming on iTunes and Amazon Music. I’m working towards a completion goal of late July. I find that music is a wonderful creative outlet and stress-reliever, as well as a perfect balance for my demanding career. It allows me to set personal goals and achieve them, which is also true of physical fitness. I’ve found that keeping my mind and body sharp improve every single facet of my life. 

15. Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.
```
 
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.
```
I was asked at the last minute to help with a major project. The deadline was just a few days away and the project had gotten derailed. As I was working on this first urgent project, I was approached by two different clients with pressing requests as well. These conflicting priorities overwhelmed me at first. Then I came up with a plan to prioritize the tasks I was given based on their level of importance. I determined which clients were the most critical to our business and who needed deliverables with the quickest turnaround. I ranked the assignments and figured out how long it would take me to finish them. Then I checked in with my coworkers, clients, and manager to see if the timeline made sense to them. We added an additional team member, stayed in the office late for a few nights, and aligned with the clients on the new timeline. In the end, I was able to complete everything on time. Each client, manager and co-worker was satisfied with my work and were happy that I communicated my revised timeline so there weren’t any surprises at the end of the project. 

When I worked for a technology company in the 3D printing space, their org had me reporting directly to a VP of North American Sales, as well the global VP of Sales based in Tel Aviv. This dotted line structure led to inherent priority conflict, as I was taking direction from 2 different department heads with very different expectations. I was not able to perform my role effectively with multiple managers, and it caused much undue stress. I approached my direct manager of our North American operation and asked that he contact the VP of our corporate location in Israel to request a change in reporting structure. Fortunately, I had already established myself as a valuable, contributing team member. This allowed me to approach this escalation with confidence, as my manager knew I was committed to excellence in my role. It turned out that this was a much larger, company-wide issue, and by bringing my situation to the attention of leadership, a larger conversation about reporting structure began. Ultimately, the company made the decision to phase out the dotted line reporting matrix globally. 

16. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
```
The key to answering this question is to focus on what you can give to the employers or the role. Here are three tips:
 
Break the time into chunks.
Let them know what you might do in each two-to-three year period. This helps the interviewer to visualize and see what you're describing. Take them through what you plan to do in the first few years and how you plan to take it up a notch in the years after that.
 
Talk about how your goals will help them.
Paint a vivid picture about the value that you plan to deliver within each of those two-to-three year chunks that you described.
 
Avoid talking about job titles.
Resist the urge to tell them about what you want your position to be in two, three, or five years because that can come off as overly presumptuous.

My professional experience has provided a strong foundation and invaluable insight into my strengths, interests, and areas of opportunity. In the next 5 years, my aim is to continue to build strong relationships and trust by establishing myself as an expert in my field. This will require dedicated investment both in and outside of my role, gathering new perspectives from partners, colleagues, and mentors. I plan to spend the next 2-3 years honing my leadership skills. I’m a fast learner and enthusiastic student of the industry. In each role, I have sought mentorship, and would like to provide this kind of support to others in the future. I have enjoyed owning projects and leading collaborators, and believe that management is the next right path for me. That’s just one reason why I’m drawn to your company. I’ve heard incredible things about your management training programs, and I am looking for an organization I can grow with. I believe that I have both the drive and the soft skills to be a real asset to your team for years to come.

I really enjoy my current position and have been happy to contribute to the success of the company. Within the next 5 years, I see myself taking on greater responsibility through a senior leadership role. I feel that my experience, communication skills, and creative strengths would well position me to lead a nationwide or global sales team. At this point in my career, I have already broadened my role by transitioning from a field rep to a regional manager. Under my guidance, the team has grown the regional revenue by 32% in just 15 months. We have also established a continued growth trajectory that projects 15% more growth within the next two quarters. My professional accomplishments are a testament to my ability to perform at the highest level, and I look forward to the challenge of guiding a team to use a proven sales process to maximize revenue and margins.

17. Describe your leadership style
```
Be clear about your leadership style.
Don’t be vague or ambivalent. If you're a team builder, say so. If you're tough, but fair, own it. Be very concise and clear on how you define your leadership so that they know very well what you're all about.
 
Give a detailed example that highlights it.
Talk about a situation, a problem or an obstacle, and then walk through what did you do and what was the result. What did it mean to your organization, company, and the customer? And be sure to include how you brought your team along, because this isn't all about you.
 
Show situations where you've adapted.
Life's not going to be simple. People want to see how you've grown and changed given the situation. Just like you look for that in the people you're going to hire, the same thing with the hiring manager who's looking to hire you.

For me, good leadership is about finding the best analytical approach while still caring about the people on the team. Last year, I took charge of a digital marketing campaign that wasn't getting any traction. I realized our team members didn't know what was expected. We worked together to build new metrics. I gave more responsibilities to our most engaged team member and helped another one find a different job where he could be more effective. Within three months, we were hitting our numbers and morale was vastly better. When we were ready to expand, five internal candidates asked if they could join our team. I love building productive, successful teams, and it sounds as if there would be great opportunities to do that in the job we're talking about. Why this answer worked well:She talked about what her overall philosophy was and how she was an effective leader.She shared an example of something that was a challenge, what she did to solve it, how she brought the team along, and the results that she captured from it.She wrapped it up with how it connected back to the organization.

In a word, supportive. I think it is important to understand the unique strengths and blind spots of my team members and direct reports. Knowing how to work with a range of experience, skills, and working styles plays a big role in the success of a team. We recently hired a new analyst who had limited experience in the industry and required hand-holding up front, but who we believed would learn fast. To effectively lead, I had to know when to step in and course correct, and when to let them make their own mistakes and learn by experience for maximum growth. Conversely, a contractor I managed in a prior role had significantly more subject matter expertise than I did. I recognized this and positioned myself as a support structure — I helped clear the path for her to achieve her goals. I believe that good leaders pay attention, listen actively, and play to the strengths of each partner and colleague. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to assess all skill sets on the team to fully optimize projects.The answer detailed the balance of giving direct input versus letting the team explore.

18. Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake
```
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

In my first job, my manager asked me to develop several forms of tracking projects. I said “yes” because I wanted to do everything my manager asked me to do. But as I started working on the project, I realized I didn't understand the overall goal. And the project ended up creating templates that didn't meet my manager's expectations. My manager was disappointed in me. She told me that if I had asked some clarifying questions, I would've gotten to a better work product. I admitted to my manager that I had made a mistake and learned that it doesn't make you look stupid if you ask clarifying questions. I learned that it's better to speak up quickly. That's how I've handled those situations ever since. Why this answer worked well:She owned her mistake, going straight to the point and describing a situation with the right level of detail.She reflected on what she did wrong—not asking clarifying questions—and how that negatively impacted her work.She talked about what she learned from the experience.

During my first few months in network planning, I worked to launch a new international route for a major airline. Months of work and detailed analysis goes into every new route as many candidates are narrowed down to a few worthy of a multi-million dollar investment. Regardless, this work needs to be done at a rapid pace and with a high level of confidentiality. My team moved quickly, and my work was shared with only a few key decision makers in the company to gain approval. Unfortunately, throughout the rapid pace of work, a few key stakeholders were left out of communications and felt unprepared. They were later left to scramble and quickly adapt when they heard about my project in the media. Learning from my mistake, I developed a robust checklist of each communication that would be required prior to all subsequent launches. I also adapted it for other teams to help my peers avoid a similar oversight. Why this answer worked well:The candidate addressed the question honestly, and described actions taken to avoid repeating the mistake.Adapting the solution for peers shows the candidate’s dedication to the company, and indicates a team player mentality.

My company had kicked off a highly controversial cross-functional initiative. I was the project lead with a team of three Product Managers, though I was not their direct manager. One of the Product Managers was many years my senior and a level above me in the organization. Throughout the process, I found that he was working around me, looping me out, and stalling the process by surfacing problems without recommending solutions. I set aside time for us to chat directly. I shared some of the challenges and pressure I was facing, making myself vulnerable to create space for him to be receptive. I explained the tension I was feeling with regards to our working relationship and asked what I could do to help improve the situation. This allowed us to clear the air, identify issues, brainstorm solutions, and commit to a healthier form of partnership moving forward. It was a powerful reminder of the value of communication and the importance of transparency and honesty on teams. Seeing one another in a humanizing light allowed us to build a stronger team. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated strong leadership with the ability to “manage up” when team members have seniority.The answer outlined important soft skills like problem solving, communication, and emotional intelligence.

As a Business Analyst, my job was to create requirements documents or pitches for new projects to present to a board of directors for approval. One of the board members was notorious for poking holes and asked us to gather more information, causing significant delays. This made stakeholders very unhappy. I reached out to this board member to better understand his concerns and identify ways to streamline the process. I looked back at the proposals and identified three themes of concern that kept coming up. We ran proposed changes by the board, and then modified the template accordingly. We also implemented a new practice to share the proposals with the board before meetings to stay ahead of questions. Our approval rates tripled! In the end, uncovering the root of a difficult relationship was beneficial to our process and all parties involved. Why this answer worked well:The answer shows that the candidate has a proactive problem-solving mentality and is capable of turning challenges into opportunities.Resolving this difficulty prevented delays for future projects and improved collaboration with board members and stakeholders.

20. Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone
```
The day before a major management review, I was told we only had ten minutes to present our project. We had originally been promised fifteen. Most of our team members agreed to shorten their remarks. One person refused to make changes. I suggested that we sit down over coffee and talk about it. I started by listening, letting him explain how hard he'd worked. I realized the issue wasn't about the length of his speech but more about him being recognized for doing a thorough job and getting his presentation together. He was proud of his work. So, we talked about another way of recognizing his efforts by acknowledging him in our team newsletter. When we wrapped up that part of the conversation, he volunteered to shorten his part of his speech. By treating his contributions with respect, I guided him to a better outcome. Why this answer worked well:He created an alternate path that supported this coworker’s goal without wrecking the entire project.He summed it up well at the end showing how he can be persuasive without dominating the conversation.

At a key moment in my previous role, my team was trying to balance the growth of our user base and safety of users. We were exploring many solutions for this problem, and my role was to align the team. Our engineering manager had a strong perspective on a solution that was technically straightforward, but did not fully address both needs. Our designer wanted to implement a more complicated, but comprehensive solution. I believed that the latter seemed like the appropriate course of action, but it needed an additional layer of depth to fully address concerns from all parties. First, I partnered with the designer to outline the solution and create a framework that detailed key benefits and potential downsides. Next, I brought in an engineering counterpart to break down the costs and timing implications of building a comprehensive solution. These inputs enabled a strong case for the more complicated, but ultimately more meaningful solution. Enthusiastic team alignment made timely leadership buy-in possible. While I had to invest more detail work upfront, we were able to shave off a few weeks by broadening our technical brainstorms throughout the early stages — which allowed us to complete the project ahead of schedule Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to identify project gaps and build a strong case towards the more optimal solution.The answer clearly outlined the approaches and strategies behind each action, which ultimately lead to improved efficiency and timely delivery.

As a software engineer, I had to persuade my marketing and sales teams that deploying a new version of the software was the right thing for our consumers and clients because the existing version was vulnerable to cyber attacks. The teams were against a new version because they believed it would cause client dissatisfaction. Additionally, these security enhancements came with a 23% cost increase. To reframe the value equation, I took three steps. First, I enrolled leading cyber attack experts to educate everyone on the impending risks from foreign entities. This reinforced the urgent business imperative of investing in secured systems. Next, I partnered with my finance team and determined that the cost of “fixing” systems after an attack amounted to a 77% increase in spend — to say nothing of intangibles like reputational damage. Finally, I hired a market research group to bring a group of "non-techy" folks to conduct a live, in-person demo of our new interface. The group demonstrated the new software with ease. Marketing and sales were so convinced that they asked me to join them in key client meetings to lead the sales pitch myself. Clients not only loved the new system, but revenues increased by 32% with the development of a premium version. Why this answer worked well:The answer clearly laid out the scenario, challenges, and steps.The candidate’s actions were a blend of strategic, cross-functional, and technical skills, resulting in quantifiable success.
```

21. Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone

My team was given a new goal: to sell our product to a new customer segment that we hadn’t served in the past. The group had strong opinions about the approach we should take. In spite of their voices, I had concerns about their strategy; I thought it may fail as it didn't align with the client’s core needs. But I was in the minority and when I spoke up I wasn't heard. I needed to find another way to make the case to my teammates. I set up a focus group with a potential client so my team could understand the challenges and priorities of the people we aimed to serve. The great news was they saw that our planned product wouldn't meet these needs, but if we made some slight adjustments to the service, we could deliver something of real value. The team rallied behind this and got on board. We were ultimately successful in bringing this client onboard—and ten more! Why this answer worked well:She shared a succinct example of a time when her opinion was in the minority.She came up with a creative way to change her team’s perspective.She used this new strategy and described how well it worked.

During my time on the growth strategy team, I partnered with various brand and finance teams to create a promotion and events calendar to maximize portfolio performance. This was especially challenging because each brand team was only responsible for their brand’s performance, while my job was to help ensure that the entire portfolio succeeds. This created an inherent discord in the exercise. In the past, teams would look back at the previous year’s events with the goal of essentially replicating them. It occurred to me that this may not be the most efficient way to plan the calendar, since the process didn’t involve any real evaluation of success. My partners were reluctant to let go of the existing process. To get buy-in, I prepared two scenarios. One used the old approach. The other used my new suggested approach with event evaluation criteria — showing both the monthly and total year sales estimate for each brand, as well as the entire portfolio. To make sure my case was airtight, I’d pre-worked with other cross-functional teams to ensure that the new projections were compatible with monthly product supply numbers and trade allowances. I was able to get buy-in and implement the new process, which has allowed us to factor in accurate estimates, measure success, and increase the efficiency of event planning. Why this answer worked well:The answer demonstrated the candidate’s ability to evaluate and optimize an existing process, using data and key performance metrics.The candidate showed flexibility in his approach through scenario planning, seeking a win-win solution for all partners.The outcome was a more strategic process and a net positive for the company.

22. Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it

In my line of work, most top performers have MBAs. I couldn't afford to step out of the workforce for two years to earn one. But I promised myself to do everything possible to earn an MBA within three years while working full-time. I found a top-rated online program and started setting my alarm clock for 5:30 a.m. I set goals of two hours of study time in the morning and evening, and made detailed to-do lists to manage both my study schedule and my other work responsibilities. It was incredibly hard, but I persisted and managed every minute of my day—and achieved my goal. Why this answer worked well:He chose a goal that’s clear, ambitious, and relevant to his career.He described specific actions he took to achieve his objectives.He made it clear that he accomplished his goal.

I was two weeks into my first role with a new company when the leader of our business unit requested to showcase all the technology my team was working on, plus two brand new demos in the grand opening of our New York City office — in just six weeks. My manager tagged me to lead the charge. Most of our projects weren’t client-ready, which would mean lots of coding and testing to do in a short period of time. I don’t think anyone thought we’d have it 100% ready in time. I gathered the team and explained to them that we had a really cool opportunity, and asked for their ideas. I didn’t sugarcoat how hard it would be, but promised to do everything I could to clear the path. In the next few weeks, I quickly re-prioritized our Jira backlog to put other non-critical projects on pause and communicated to those stakeholders. I then implemented weekly sprints and daily standups to reduce meeting overhead and increase the time available for them to code and test in pairs. And to keep up morale, I requested funds from leadership to sponsor dinners for the team when they worked late, and even secured travel funds so that our developers could attend the opening. Through careful re-prioritization, open communication and keeping the morale high, we were able to successfully deliver the demo as the result. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was realistic about the challenge, but created a clear plan to meet the timeline.The candidate demonstrated leadership by encouraging morale and securing a team reward.

23. Tell me about a time you surpassed people’s expectations
```
As a young professional, I was given a small event to manage for my company's senior executives. We originally expected about 50 attendees, but then the CEO decided to participate too. Suddenly, the event became much bigger with 400 people attending. We had to organize buses, food, scripted content, speeches and the program itself. I stepped up and designed carefully crafted messaging documents for each stakeholder; had weekly check-ins with each group; and ran volunteer training sessions to be sure that all the logistics ran smoothly. I learned the importance of careful planning and constant practice; two habits that paid off on many projects since then. The event is now considered the most successful of our division. My boss praised my work for going far beyond what she expected when the project was first assigned. Why this answer worked well:She painted a picture of how she approached a new problem.She explained how she adjusted throughout to meet challenges as they arose.She described the successful outcome and its implications for her job.

In my role as Business Analyst, I was responsible for analyzing and implementing strategies for key products. Due to a combination of an organizational restructuring and employee attrition, my team of four shrunk down to a team of two: my new leader and me. At this stage, I combined some key skill sets. I used my technical expertise to create and automate new models that would capture potential opportunities, and my ability to communicate complicated results in simple language to support our sales team’s efforts. The automation led to greater efficiency, and my communication and relationship-building skills helped the sales team create client-specific onboarding strategies. This enabled us to continue to keep the business going with minimal impact. I was recognized by senior leadership for being able to pivot quickly in unpredictable circumstances and make the most of a difficult situation. Why this answer worked well:The candidate used both soft and technical skill sets to maintain output with reduced headcount.The answer demonstrated a growth mindset by showing adaptability, innovation, and the willingness to rethink how their role can be done.

24. Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure
```
I was working on my company's big quarterly project update when two team members left unexpectedly and we were short-handed with three weeks to go. I convened an urgent strategy session where we identified all the projects they were involved in and mapped out our action plan. We shared the most important tasks within the team and got them all done in time. We canceled two optional features that could wait a quarter, and we reached out to a former intern who was able to deliver 15 hours of remote work in the last weekend sprint before the deadline. We were able to complete the project without a delay and delivered on all the essential deliverables by being creative, strategic, and very focused. Why this answer worked well:She described herself as a friendly leader who got to work addressing the challenge for the entire team.She took us through a strategy where she focused on the most important elements and deprioritized the rest.She was creative and resourceful by finding an unexpected ally to help her through this challenge.
```
During my time as an analyst for a major airline, I was pulled into a special project where we were asked to look at a potential merger scenario with another carrier. Due to the confidentiality of the project, I was unable to work with peers or use my normal channels for support, and was required to meet a demanding work schedule in order to complete our evaluation in the allotted time. While this project leveraged some of my existing skills, there was still a lot I needed to learn about our acquisition target to complete the work. I made my family aware that I’d need to temporarily shift my evening hours to work. This proactive communication prevented me from facing compounding pressure. I also made sure to communicate daily with my VP. He knew the unique challenge I was facing and could provide guidance, but only if he knew where to help. So I set up daily check-ins with him to show him my progress and receive feedback in a 1:1 setting outside of our normal working group. This added communication helped me avoid any surprises, eased stress, and allowed me to successfully manage and complete an unfamiliar project. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated flexibility by being willing to deviate from a normal workflow.The candidate demonstrated the ability to learn new skills and processes quickly.

When I was working as a Systems Integration Manager, I was responsible for onboarding a client to our TMS (transportation management solution) on a tight timeline. This was challenging because the client managed their own transportation independently. None of their data or invoicing for freight was centralized, and I was missing a lot of information. We needed to hit our target go-live date because my company had already hired employees for the account and needed the revenue. I knew that I needed to get the info by the end of the week to ensure that I could validate assumptions used for RFP, margin, resource leveling, and so on. I set up a call with the client and they explained that they were short on manpower and would need more time. I offered to visit the sites, conduct the interviews, complete the site and freight profiles, and take all necessary photos. Once I gathered the information, my team keyed in the data and we hit our go-live date without a moment to spare. The project was a success. We hit our revenue numbers as planned, no money was lost, and all parties were very pleased. Thanks to the extra effort, our relationship with that client is stronger than ever. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed leadership by going the extra mile to accomplish a goal for both the company and the client.Success was framed in a way that captured both the short-term impact to the project (meeting sales goals) and the long-term benefit to company growth (strengthening a business relationship).

25. Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly
```
When I started in my role, I thought I was quite good at Excel. I had told my employer that I knew how to calculate complex formulas, but I quickly discovered that my experience was well behind that of my peers. I didn’t want my boss to know that I was trailing in my capabilities just as I stepped into the new role, so I came up with a plan to teach myself everything I was missing. Every day after work, I watched at least an hour of Khan Academy videos. I also found practice worksheets online that allowed me to test myself and be sure I was mastering the content. Within three weeks, I was nearly as fast and fluent as my colleagues at work, and my boss never knew I had come in behind. Why this answer worked well:She showed initiative by going above and beyond after work to catch up to her peers.She was specific in what she didn’t know and then told a clear and concise story about what she needed to do to change the situation.She described how with focus and hard work she was able to catch up rather quickly.

Due to change in senior leadership, we had to aggressively rethink our approach on the next evolution of cloud technology. I led a company-wide effort to define and execute a strategy to move towards a subscription-based cloud solution. First, I worked with my team to define our areas of focus, starting from understanding how our products should work in the future based on the needs, behaviors, desires, and emotions of the customers. We then examined our capabilities as well as current gaps within supply chain, engineering, design, marketing, and sales. We looked at how customers interact with our products. We also obtained third party market research to identify opportunities. From there, I developed a strategy map to lay out ways in which the organization needed to evolve to succeed, and built both business and product roadmaps based on this strategy. Within 8 months, we were able to get full alignment within the team and executed the strategy. We were able to migrate the original solutions to on-prem, hybrid, and private clouds and rolled out offerings to over 100 countries. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated a comfort level with high visibility, high stakes projects.The example showed the candidate’s ability to strategize and execute a plan within an aggressive timeline.


26. Do you have any questions for me?
```
I do have a few questions. Thanks for asking. We talked a bit about your plans to invest in training opportunities for your current employees, especially those who will be managing the company's transition to a centralized billing system. I think that this is a great plan, and I'd love to support the curriculum development. Now, will most of the training modules be designed by this team? And will they be delivered in person, via webinar, or a video format? Or will you be using a hybrid approach? Why this answer worked well:She showed that she had been paying attention to the conversation.She wanted to delve a bit further into a topic that they’ve just discussed.She conveyed a lot of enthusiasm about supporting what sounds like a priority project for that organization.
```
Earlier in our conversation, you mentioned that there were some tensions between these two teams. Can you share more about where that comes from, and how you think this will impact me in my role? I’m very excited to hear that you’re also passionate about making sure that gig economy workers are paid a fair living wage. What are some of the biggest challenges in preventing our team from delivering on this promise? Recently, I saw that the company had to deal with a sensitive subject on the news. How was this perceived and discussed internally? Why this answer worked well:The candidate referenced earlier parts of the conversation, showing that they were interested and engaged.The questions show that an awareness of and interest in how the company is perceived.

How do you think I should approach the first 30 days in the role to best position myself for success in a new culture? I know that your company has won numerous awards for workplace and community culture, and I have always prided myself in helping colleagues get active in the community. What do opportunities look like within your organization to get involved? Why this answer worked well:The answer shows that the candidate has done their homework, and has a genuine interest in getting involved across different aspects of the company culture and activities.The candidate showed their desire to be successful in the role by already thinking about the onboarding process.

What do you see as the most critical component of your business today that will contribute to your long-term success? What challenges does your organization face today that you are working to overcome? Regarding my role, what would you consider to be the most important factor to ensuring success? Why this answer worked well:The candidate asked insightful questions that show their willingness to be successful and ask for guidance.The answer showed interest in the future of the company.
