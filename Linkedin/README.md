# Linkedin Interview questions

1. Tell me about yourself?
```
Tips;
This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.
 
Be succinct, honest and engaging.
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.
 
Use the job description to prepare.
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.
 
Tie your story to their needs.
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.
```

I was always a problem solver. 

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most.

I’ve taken on many different types of projects. 

I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles.

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.

2. What is your greatest strength? 
```
When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.
 
Describe a relevant experience.
If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.
 
Give specific details.
Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.
 
Show them you’re a well-rounded person.
For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.
```
My greatest strength is strategic thinking.

Over the last several years, I’ve realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized.

My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the business. This well-rounded view allows me to connect with colleagues from disparate departments and points of view quickly and authentically.

3. What is your greatest weakness? 
```
This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:
 
Be humble.
You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.
 
Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.
For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role
 
Show how you manage it.
Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.
```
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines.

In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives

I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible.

4. Why sould we hire you?
```
This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:
 
Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified.
Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.
 
Tell them how you’d fit in.
Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well.
 
Speak authentically.
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.
```
I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

I’m motivated and excited to learn your company’s unique business model, and from my interactions with the employees here, I can see that we share values like respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experiences and attitude for the job and think that my varied experience can add a lot of value here.

I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year. Given the growth moment that your company is poised to have, I believe that my unique experience will be an asset to your team. I’m excited to expand my expertise within a new industry, and recommend key strategies and opportunities that will support and drive business. Why this answer worked well:The answer featured a blend of quantifiable results and personal strengths.There was clear awareness of the company’s trajectory and enthusiasm for the role.

5. Why do you want to work here?
```
Make it all about them.
Your best answer will be about what they need. It'll show that you've done your research and have thought through what you can contribute to that team.
 
Show them how you can help.
Weave your story into the context of what you can contribute. If you have strong accounting skills and are interviewing for a finance role at a humane society, you could suggest that this job would allow you to blend your professional skills with your passion for animals.
 
Speak from the heart.
Telling a genuine story can make a big difference. For example, I once worked with a client who was applying for a zoo event manager job and she had grown up next door to that zoo and had great memories of the peacocks flying over the fence and sitting on her dad's car. So her answer was that she wanted people to have fun memories of that zoo just like she did. Try to top that.
```

I have spoken to people who worked here previously and I was always highly impressed on how highly they spoke about the company and how well they developed themselves. I admire your mentor program and have always believed that mentorship is key to a company’s success and an individual’s personal and professional growth. I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting fast growth company with such a potential with my skills well-suited to add value to the company’s growth. Within the last three years, for example, I set the goal of growing and evolving my team. I was able to coach and promote three different partnership employees into new roles. I was also able to optimize pricing and promotions, which saved the company money and resources and exceeded revenue projections three years in a row. My track record of outperforming expectations and ability lead will help accelerate the fascinating growth you are seeing

I understand that you’re looking for a leader who can implement and scale your data analytics platform. Over the course of my career, I have implemented data analytics platforms for 3 companies. Each had its own unique challenges and required me to learn, grow, and expand my skill set. I’m energized by new and complex challenges, and have the background, experience, and successful track record required to implement this system within your organization. The space in which your company operates is also of personal interest to me and I would love to contribute to it and help the company grow. When I started at my current company, I had a team of 4 people which I scaled to 28 people. I led the team in designing and building a big data platform for this big global company. Ultimately, we expanded the user base from 100 to 1,200. I’m looking forward to the next chapter and challenge, and believe I can bring real value to this organization

6. Tell me about a time you showed leadership
```
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.
 
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.
```

Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project

I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn’t their reporting manager but I was the project lead, so I asked them to explain the pros and cons of their approach. I encouraged them to fairly assess their solutions and moderated the discussion so that it stayed productive and respectful.

During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall.

I joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch which was moderately successful, but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains. I quickly realized that we’d need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future. I helped rationalize the short-term experiment roadmap, organized execution, removed roadblocks, and helped ship few of the high potential experiments. Concurrently, I spent time with the executive team to understand their expectations. After observing users and analyzing our logs, I partnered with team leads across Engineering, Design, and Research to develop an updated mission statement and a set of defined success metrics. Within 3 months, we were charging full-speed ahead with an updated roadmap, improvement operational metrics, and significant boost on a platform satisfaction survey. Two years later, the product had been used by hundreds of millions of people every month — 40 times the amount we started with

8. What would your co-workers say about you?
```
Find features that fit.
Re-read the job description and look for answers that go well with it. For example, if they need a strong problem solver, maybe you can share that your office nickname is “The Fixer” because you're so good at solving tough challenges.
 
Share some of your reviews.
Before the interview, go through your LinkedIn recommendations and performance reviews and see if there are some gold nuggets you might want to show them. And if it's on LinkedIn, mention it to the interviewers so they can read the whole recommendation if they want more detail.
 
Back it up with evidence.
If you think your colleagues would say that you're super creative, resist the urge to say “People like that I can think outside of the box”. Instead, share a tangible example of your creativity that ties to the job description.
```
I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time. I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday. I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too

I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what’s most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we’re all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my “infectious enthusiasm” with others and rally the team, and also means that I spend a lot of time with my work to make sure it’s done well. My teams have solid track records of hitting if not exceeding their goals because of this focus and ability to motivate. A good example was when I was working with quite a large group, and our project was given to us top-down. This didn’t feel empowering for the team, but I worked with leadership and our user research team to help the engineers and designers recognize the value of what we were working on. It was slated to be a multiyear project, but because the team was motivated and we focused on creating specifications for the product, we were able to deliver a prototype in just a few months. 

9. Why do you want to leave your current role?
```
Hiring managers will often ask this question, and it's a test. Are you running away from something, or are you running towards something? The advice when you get this question is simple:
 
Stay positive.
Employers want to see that you have a good attitude in general. Resist the temptation to say bad things about your current job, employer, or boss.
 
Focus on where you’d like to go.
You should come off as someone who is looking forward, not backward. Portray your interests more in the light of what you want to get out of your next role.
 
Bring it back to them.
Show them that you’ve done your homework about their company, and relate what you tell them back to the specific job you're interviewing for.
```
I'm eager to find a new opportunity and grow. As you can see, I've been doing the same kind of work for two and a half years, and I'm starting to stagnate. My company doesn't have a role open for the next step up, unfortunately. So, I'm excited about the opportunity of becoming a sales manager at your company. The new role will let me use the skills I've developed in my current role like making cold calls; hooking in new clients with pithy-but-inspiring opening lines; following up with carefully crafted emails; listening to their pain points; and then offering up solutions that can solve their problems. I'm eager to make a fresh start, and I want to use my cold calling and listening skills to help craft an even better solution with the product I'd be working on in this new role

I believe that the key to long-term professional growth is gathering critical, foundational experiences. In my case, my aspiration is to lead a large multinational business in a general managerial capacity. To get there, I have identified a set of enabling experiences, and have been very intentional in choosing my roles and assignments so far. While I have learned an immense amount in my current role as a strategic insights marketing manager, I believe that it’s the right time to expand my learning with a new challenge. Over the last 4 years, I have worked across a variety of marketing, strategy, and sales assignments across different global regions. I’ve built a strong understanding of how to sustainably grow brands & businesses through consumer-centric strategies. 

10. Describe your most challenged project
```
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.

In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals. I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable. In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus

I was brought into a project right before the ramp, when the existing team ran into a blocker issue. They were severely constrained in both resources and time, and didn’t have the bandwidth to address it. Obviously, there was a lot at stake. The expectation was that I would quickly solve the issue, but I was coming in completely cold and the team was stressed and resistant to stop what they were doing to bring me up to speed. Success required two things. First, I needed to clearly explain exactly what I needed from each team member — and why. Second, I needed to gather this information and context as quickly and efficiently as possible.

11. Tell me about something you have accoplished that you are proud of
```
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.

```
In my role on the innovation strategy team, I helped create a long-term innovation pipeline which led to multiple product launches for a critical business unit. While the company was a market leader in the space, we had been rapidly losing market share over the last few years. My first action was to identify the root cause of our declines. Through a detailed analysis, I identified that our product lineup didn’t fully satisfy evolving consumer needs. I also examined our past product launches and found that they’d lacked differentiated utility. I got approval from leadership to take an end-to-end approach using design thinking. We started with consumer immersions to understand how our products are used and which barriers we’d need to overcome. From there, we created new product concepts. We tested the concepts with consumers and created a long-term innovation pipeline. Finally, we partnered with cross-functional teams to charter and launch 3 products in just 2 years. This increased market share for the first time in 5 years, and we have seen sustained sales growth ever since. 


12. Can you explain your employment gap?
```
Most people are nervous about how a gap will be perceived—even if there's a good explanation, But if they’ve invited you in for an interview, then the gap hasn’t ruled you out. Here are some tips on how to discuss it:
 
Be honest.
The truth will set you free. Try to put the situation into the best light and don't lie; it's bound to come back and haunt you. So if your job was eliminated through a merger, just say so.
 
Speak with confidence.
For example, if you had taken some time away from working, avoid acting like you're embarrassed, apologetic or ashamed. The interviewer is going to pick up on that. Instead, pause and you see how they respond. The more calm, succinct and confident you are, the more at ease the interviewer will be with your answer—and with you.
 
Show the benefits of your time off.
Bring up the good that came out of that time whether you were laid off, stepped away to be with family, or even got fired. It's a great way to reframe the situation and an opportunity to showcase some useful skills that you gained during that time.
```
Looking at my resume, you’ll notice I have an employment gap of 5 months. I was relocating internationally and had to go through the administrative process of procuring my travel visa and work authorization permits. During this time, I couldn’t legally be employed abroad. The time off was a blessing. It allowed me to recharge my batteries and use the time to stay current with industry and consumer trends. I took the opportunity to evaluate my career journey and make sure I was working towards my long-term goal of being a multinational general manager. Without the day-to-day hustle, I was able to be introspective and distill the lessons I’d taken away in previous roles, and start planning my intentions for the next. I also used the time to read up on the latest developments in design thinking and innovation, and even took a couple online courses in these spaces

13. What are your salary expectations?
```
This is a question you'll get all too often, so here are a few tips to help you master the answer:
 
Give them a salary range.
Let them know there’s room to negotiate (instead of starting with a specific number). Avoid going too low though, because that's going to work against your interests. And don’t go too high either, or you may freeze yourself out of the opportunity.
 
Do some neutral research.
Give them a reasonable place to start from. You can use a resource like the LinkedIn Salary Tool to find out what other companies are paying people in this role and share with them what you learned about this salary range. Then they’ll have to base their compensation at least on those numbers because you've let them know what other similar organizations are giving to employees who do that job.
 
Bring up signing bonuses. 
Doing this can create a win-win situation for both parties. At the end of a negotiation, asking for extra money up top is often a way to bridge the gap between what you want and what you’re being offered.
```
I've been doing some research on the market for the role of Sales Analyst. What I found from LinkedIn's salary tool is that here in Chicago, base pay for these jobs tends to run between $61,000 and $71,000. Half the companies pay bonuses as well. Given the global impact of your company, and the fact that candidates with Master's degrees, like me, are being recruited most heavily, I think we should be looking toward the top end of that range. Why this answer worked well:She started off by giving a salary range instead of a specific number.She brought neutral research to the table, which establishes her as someone who's trustworthy, bold and grounded.She did a credible job of showing why she should be at that higher range, which made her come across as confident and steady.

14. What you do like to do outside of work?
```
With this question, employers are looking to get a feel for your likability and cultural fit. So what should you say—and not say? Here are a few tips.
 
Pick one of your favorites.
Go ahead and share something about your hobbies, volunteer work, or the places you enjoy traveling to. Maybe you're taking classes to help you accelerate your skills. In general, you just want to tell them something that's true and will paint you as an interesting, healthy, or good human being.
 
Keep it short.
For example, if you're a bird watcher in your free time, skip the 22-minute account of every species you've ever documented. Share enthusiastically so your passion shines through, but don't ramble on endlessly. Doing so might give the people to whom you're trying to make a good impression the feeling that you're nervous or that brevity just isn't your strong suit.
 
Stick to appropriate topics.
Avoid anything that might be pulverizing or offends somebody who's not a part of a particular group like politics or religion. Choose something uncontroversial or beneficial, and take advantage of the opportunity to show them that you're the complete package.
```
I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I’ve backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across Asia, South and Central America. For our honeymoon, my wife and I travelled northern India for 6 weeks. It’s a very diverse region, home to Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists, and we really enjoyed spending time in a few different states. We did a diverse set of activities like hiking the Himalayas and Ladakh, finding cool hot springs, and Vipassana meditation. Vipassan is a 10 days of silence meditation. I’ve really connected with the technique and have found it to be a powerful way to focus my attention and reset myself. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed interest in learning from people with different backgrounds.The answer included hobbies centered around health and self-improvement.

Outside of work, I enjoy fitness training, perfecting my golf swing, writing and recording music, and taking care of my dogs. This year I will be releasing my 4th album, which is all-instrumental, featuring classical guitar. I play every instrument and record tracks at my home office. Currently, two are streaming on iTunes and Amazon Music. I’m working towards a completion goal of late July. I find that music is a wonderful creative outlet and stress-reliever, as well as a perfect balance for my demanding career. It allows me to set personal goals and achieve them, which is also true of physical fitness. I’ve found that keeping my mind and body sharp improve every single facet of my life. 

15. Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.
```
 
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.
```
I was asked at the last minute to help with a major project. The deadline was just a few days away and the project had gotten derailed. As I was working on this first urgent project, I was approached by two different clients with pressing requests as well. These conflicting priorities overwhelmed me at first. Then I came up with a plan to prioritize the tasks I was given based on their level of importance. I determined which clients were the most critical to our business and who needed deliverables with the quickest turnaround. I ranked the assignments and figured out how long it would take me to finish them. Then I checked in with my coworkers, clients, and manager to see if the timeline made sense to them. We added an additional team member, stayed in the office late for a few nights, and aligned with the clients on the new timeline. In the end, I was able to complete everything on time. Each client, manager and co-worker was satisfied with my work and were happy that I communicated my revised timeline so there weren’t any surprises at the end of the project. 

When I worked for a technology company in the 3D printing space, their org had me reporting directly to a VP of North American Sales, as well the global VP of Sales based in Tel Aviv. This dotted line structure led to inherent priority conflict, as I was taking direction from 2 different department heads with very different expectations. I was not able to perform my role effectively with multiple managers, and it caused much undue stress. I approached my direct manager of our North American operation and asked that he contact the VP of our corporate location in Israel to request a change in reporting structure. Fortunately, I had already established myself as a valuable, contributing team member. This allowed me to approach this escalation with confidence, as my manager knew I was committed to excellence in my role. It turned out that this was a much larger, company-wide issue, and by bringing my situation to the attention of leadership, a larger conversation about reporting structure began. Ultimately, the company made the decision to phase out the dotted line reporting matrix globally. 

16. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
```
The key to answering this question is to focus on what you can give to the employers or the role. Here are three tips:
 
Break the time into chunks.
Let them know what you might do in each two-to-three year period. This helps the interviewer to visualize and see what you're describing. Take them through what you plan to do in the first few years and how you plan to take it up a notch in the years after that.
 
Talk about how your goals will help them.
Paint a vivid picture about the value that you plan to deliver within each of those two-to-three year chunks that you described.
 
Avoid talking about job titles.
Resist the urge to tell them about what you want your position to be in two, three, or five years because that can come off as overly presumptuous.

My professional experience has provided a strong foundation and invaluable insight into my strengths, interests, and areas of opportunity. In the next 5 years, my aim is to continue to build strong relationships and trust by establishing myself as an expert in my field. This will require dedicated investment both in and outside of my role, gathering new perspectives from partners, colleagues, and mentors. I plan to spend the next 2-3 years honing my leadership skills. I’m a fast learner and enthusiastic student of the industry. In each role, I have sought mentorship, and would like to provide this kind of support to others in the future. I have enjoyed owning projects and leading collaborators, and believe that management is the next right path for me. That’s just one reason why I’m drawn to your company. I’ve heard incredible things about your management training programs, and I am looking for an organization I can grow with. I believe that I have both the drive and the soft skills to be a real asset to your team for years to come.

I really enjoy my current position and have been happy to contribute to the success of the company. Within the next 5 years, I see myself taking on greater responsibility through a senior leadership role. I feel that my experience, communication skills, and creative strengths would well position me to lead a nationwide or global sales team. At this point in my career, I have already broadened my role by transitioning from a field rep to a regional manager. Under my guidance, the team has grown the regional revenue by 32% in just 15 months. We have also established a continued growth trajectory that projects 15% more growth within the next two quarters. My professional accomplishments are a testament to my ability to perform at the highest level, and I look forward to the challenge of guiding a team to use a proven sales process to maximize revenue and margins.

17. Describe your leadership style
```
Be clear about your leadership style.
Don’t be vague or ambivalent. If you're a team builder, say so. If you're tough, but fair, own it. Be very concise and clear on how you define your leadership so that they know very well what you're all about.
 
Give a detailed example that highlights it.
Talk about a situation, a problem or an obstacle, and then walk through what did you do and what was the result. What did it mean to your organization, company, and the customer? And be sure to include how you brought your team along, because this isn't all about you.
 
Show situations where you've adapted.
Life's not going to be simple. People want to see how you've grown and changed given the situation. Just like you look for that in the people you're going to hire, the same thing with the hiring manager who's looking to hire you.

For me, good leadership is about finding the best analytical approach while still caring about the people on the team. Last year, I took charge of a digital marketing campaign that wasn't getting any traction. I realized our team members didn't know what was expected. We worked together to build new metrics. I gave more responsibilities to our most engaged team member and helped another one find a different job where he could be more effective. Within three months, we were hitting our numbers and morale was vastly better. When we were ready to expand, five internal candidates asked if they could join our team. I love building productive, successful teams, and it sounds as if there would be great opportunities to do that in the job we're talking about. Why this answer worked well:She talked about what her overall philosophy was and how she was an effective leader.She shared an example of something that was a challenge, what she did to solve it, how she brought the team along, and the results that she captured from it.She wrapped it up with how it connected back to the organization.

In a word, supportive. I think it is important to understand the unique strengths and blind spots of my team members and direct reports. Knowing how to work with a range of experience, skills, and working styles plays a big role in the success of a team. We recently hired a new analyst who had limited experience in the industry and required hand-holding up front, but who we believed would learn fast. To effectively lead, I had to know when to step in and course correct, and when to let them make their own mistakes and learn by experience for maximum growth. Conversely, a contractor I managed in a prior role had significantly more subject matter expertise than I did. I recognized this and positioned myself as a support structure — I helped clear the path for her to achieve her goals. I believe that good leaders pay attention, listen actively, and play to the strengths of each partner and colleague. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to assess all skill sets on the team to fully optimize projects.The answer detailed the balance of giving direct input versus letting the team explore.
