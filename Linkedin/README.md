# Linkedin Interview questions

1. Tell me about yourself?
```
Tips;
This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.
 
Be succinct, honest and engaging.
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.
 
Use the job description to prepare.
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.
 
Tie your story to their needs.
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.

I was always a problem solver. 

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most.

I’ve taken on many different types of projects. 

I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles.

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.

2. What is your greatest strength? 
```
When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.
 
Describe a relevant experience.
If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.
 
Give specific details.
Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.
 
Show them you’re a well-rounded person.
For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.
```
My greatest strength is strategic thinking.

Over the last several years, I’ve realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized.

My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the business. This well-rounded view allows me to connect with colleagues from disparate departments and points of view quickly and authentically.

3. What is your greatest weakness? 
```
This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:
 
Be humble.
You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.
 
Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.
For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role
 
Show how you manage it.
Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.
```
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines.

In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives

I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible.

4. Why sould we hire you?
```
This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:
 
Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified.
Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.
 
Tell them how you’d fit in.
Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well.
 
Speak authentically.
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.

I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

I’m motivated and excited to learn your company’s unique business model, and from my interactions with the employees here, I can see that we share values like respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experiences and attitude for the job and think that my varied experience can add a lot of value here.

I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year. Given the growth moment that your company is poised to have, I believe that my unique experience will be an asset to your team. I’m excited to expand my expertise within a new industry, and recommend key strategies and opportunities that will support and drive business. Why this answer worked well:The answer featured a blend of quantifiable results and personal strengths.There was clear awareness of the company’s trajectory and enthusiasm for the role.

5. Why do you want to work here?
```
Make it all about them.
Your best answer will be about what they need. It'll show that you've done your research and have thought through what you can contribute to that team.
 
Show them how you can help.
Weave your story into the context of what you can contribute. If you have strong accounting skills and are interviewing for a finance role at a humane society, you could suggest that this job would allow you to blend your professional skills with your passion for animals.
 
Speak from the heart.
Telling a genuine story can make a big difference. For example, I once worked with a client who was applying for a zoo event manager job and she had grown up next door to that zoo and had great memories of the peacocks flying over the fence and sitting on her dad's car. So her answer was that she wanted people to have fun memories of that zoo just like she did. Try to top that.

I have spoken to people who worked here previously and I was always highly impressed on how highly they spoke about the company and how well they developed themselves. I admire your mentor program and have always believed that mentorship is key to a company’s success and an individual’s personal and professional growth. I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting fast growth company with such a potential with my skills well-suited to add value to the company’s growth. Within the last three years, for example, I set the goal of growing and evolving my team. I was able to coach and promote three different partnership employees into new roles. I was also able to optimize pricing and promotions, which saved the company money and resources and exceeded revenue projections three years in a row. My track record of outperforming expectations and ability lead will help accelerate the fascinating growth you are seeing

I understand that you’re looking for a leader who can implement and scale your data analytics platform. Over the course of my career, I have implemented data analytics platforms for 3 companies. Each had its own unique challenges and required me to learn, grow, and expand my skill set. I’m energized by new and complex challenges, and have the background, experience, and successful track record required to implement this system within your organization. The space in which your company operates is also of personal interest to me and I would love to contribute to it and help the company grow. When I started at my current company, I had a team of 4 people which I scaled to 28 people. I led the team in designing and building a big data platform for this big global company. Ultimately, we expanded the user base from 100 to 1,200. I’m looking forward to the next chapter and challenge, and believe I can bring real value to this organization

6. Tell me about a time you showed leadership
```
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.
 
Describe the situation.
Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.
 
Get into the action.
Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.
 
Show the results.
Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project

I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn’t their reporting manager but I was the project lead, so I asked them to explain the pros and cons of their approach. I encouraged them to fairly assess their solutions and moderated the discussion so that it stayed productive and respectful.

During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall.
