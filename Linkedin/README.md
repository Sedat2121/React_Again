# Linkedin Interview questions

1. Tell me about yourself?
```
Tips;
This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.
 
Be succinct, honest and engaging.
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.
 
Use the job description to prepare.
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.
 
Tie your story to their needs.
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.

I was always a problem solver. 

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most.

I’ve taken on many different types of projects. 

I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles.

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.

2. What is your greatest strength? 
```
When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.
 
Describe a relevant experience.
If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.
 
Give specific details.
Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.
 
Show them you’re a well-rounded person.
For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.
```
My greatest strength is strategic thinking.

Over the last several years, I’ve realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized.

My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the business. This well-rounded view allows me to connect with colleagues from disparate departments and points of view quickly and authentically.

3. What is your greatest weakness? 
```
This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:
 
Be humble.
You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.
 
Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.
For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role
 
Show how you manage it.
Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.
```
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines.

In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives

I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible.

4. Why sould we hire you?
```
This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:
 
Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified.
Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.
 
Tell them how you’d fit in.
Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well.
 
Speak authentically.
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.

I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

I’m motivated and excited to learn your company’s unique business model, and from my interactions with the employees here, I can see that we share values like respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experiences and attitude for the job and think that my varied experience can add a lot of value here.

I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year. Given the growth moment that your company is poised to have, I believe that my unique experience will be an asset to your team. I’m excited to expand my expertise within a new industry, and recommend key strategies and opportunities that will support and drive business.
