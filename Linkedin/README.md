# Linkedin Interview questions

1. Tell me about yourself?

I was always a problem solver. 

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most.

Iâ€™ve taken on many different types of projects. 

I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles.

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.
