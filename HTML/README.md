# HTML5 Interview Questions

1. What is an iframe and how it works?
An iframe is an HTML document which can be embedded inside onther HTML page.
```
<iframe src="https://github.com" height="300px" width="300px"></iframe>
```
The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

Tip: Use CSS to style the <iframe>

Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the <iframe> is.

2. What is the purpose of the alt attribute on images? 
The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The alt attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purposes, in which case it should be left empty.

3. What is difference between span and div? 
-div is a block element
-span is inline element
For bonus points, you could point out that itâ€™s illegal to place a block element inside an inline element, and that while div can have a p tag, and a p tag can have a span, it is not possible for span to have a div or p tag inside.

4. How can i get indexed better by search engines?
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:
```
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword keyword">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="description of your site">
```
Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.

5. HTML5 specifications?
HTML5 was designed to replace HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2. The key goals and motivations behind the HTML5 specification were to:

Deliver rich content (graphics, movies, etc.) without the need for additional plugins, such as Flash.
Provide better semantic support for web page structure through new structural element tags.
Provide a stricter parsing standard to simplify error handling, ensure more consistent cross-browser behaviour, and simplify compatibility with documents written to older standards.
Provide better cross-platform support whether running on a PC, Tablet, or Smartphone.
